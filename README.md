# Themecord

Discord theme that will always match your wallpaper!

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danihek/Themecord/refs/heads/main/assets/preview.gif" alt="drawing" style="width:1200px;"/>

## Why?
Because why not, I like having same theme on everything I thought it's cool.

## What does it really change?
Like in title, overall discord theme, but Themecord also contains little animations on cursor hover on specific objects, list etc.

## Dependecies
- Compatible discord client
- One of color palettes generators:
    - [hellwal](https://github.com/danihek/hellwal)
    - [python-pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal)
    - [wallust](https://codeberg.org/onemoresuza/wallust)

## Supported Clients:
- Vencord
- Vesktop

## Generating colorscheme
Before you even start doing **ANYTHING**, you have to choose if you wanna use pywal or wallust

### In case of hellwal you have to copy css file:
``./css/hellwal/discord-colors.css`` to ``~/.config/hellwal/templates/`` folder

### in case of pywal:
``./css/pywal/discord-colors.css`` to ``~/.config/wal/templates/`` folder

### and in case of wallust:
``./css/wallust/discord-colors.css`` to ``~/.config/wallust/templates/`` folder

also add to ``~/.config/wallust/wallust.toml`` required config:

```
[templates]
themecord.template = "discord-colors.css"
themecord.target = '~/.cache/wallust/discord-colors.css'
```

## Installation

``yay -S themecord``

### Manual

You can put it in ``/usr/local/bin/`` for ease of use


### NixOS
1. Add themecord to inputs(just like home-manager) in your config flake:
```
themecord = {
   url = "github:danihek/themecord";
   inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
 };
```

2. Add as a module:
```
({ config, pkgs, ... }: {
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  themecord.packages.x86_64-linux.default
  ];
})
```

and your discord client will update it's theme.

## Nix
In folder ``./nix`` you can see example how I added to my flake hellwal, wallust and pywal templates.

## Example usage

In folder ``./example`` you see example script which you can use as your template in your own script/config for changing wallpapers and edit to your needs.

## Light mode

You can use `-l` flag to use light mode like this (**hellwal** as backend ):

```sh
themecord -l
```

# Enjoy theme'in!!
